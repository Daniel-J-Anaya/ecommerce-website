# React E-Commerce Website

Welcome to the React E-Commerce Website project, created by Daniel Anaya. This project focuses on building the front-end of an e-commerce platform, using React. The current version includes basic functionality such as a home page, category pages, product pages, a login page (non-functional), and a cart page. The goal is to provide a smooth, responsive, and user-friendly shopping experience.
